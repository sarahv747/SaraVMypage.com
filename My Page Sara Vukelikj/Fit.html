<p>
  Mental and physical health are also really important.healthy body, healthy soul.I always try to work out as much as i can
  with my schedule now i try to get in 1 hour of exercise a day.<br>And in the future when i go to work full time i hope i
  will have time to work out and grow.Like they say 1 apple a day keeps the doctor away.
  The same goes for working out. When we have a balanced lifestyle everything is better including
  our performance in our work environment.
